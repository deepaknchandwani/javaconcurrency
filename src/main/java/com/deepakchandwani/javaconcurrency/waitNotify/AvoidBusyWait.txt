Busy Wait
Thread B which is to process the data is waiting for data to become available for processing.
In other words, it is waiting for a signal from thread A which causes hasDataToProcess() to return true. 
Here is the loop that thread B is running in, while waiting for this signal:

protected MySignal sharedSignal = ...

...

while(!sharedSignal.hasDataToProcess()){
  //do nothing... busy waiting
}
Notice how the while loop keeps executing until hasDataToProcess() returns true. 
This is called busy waiting. The thread is busy while waiting.
